3. Write a SQL query using the professor / department / compensation data that outputs the average number of vacation days by department:

  department_name                average_vacation_days
  -----------------------------  ---------------------
  Transfiguration                2.0
  Defence Against the Dark Arts  9.0
  Study of Ancient Runes         8.0
  Care of Magical Creatures      13.0

To do this, you'll need to explore the SQL documentation and other online resources. It requires SQL features not covered in this checkpoint like GROUP BY and avg().

  SELECT department.department_name, AVG(compensation.vacation_days) FROM department
  JOIN professor ON department.id = professor.department_id
  JOIN compensation ON professor.id = compensation.professor_id
  GROUP BY department.department_name;
